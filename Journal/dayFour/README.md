# Day four

On day four I added the ability to select the range of data shown in the graph in the web app I made. I also learnt about **docker** and how to make the necessary files to make the project ready to be built into a docker image. This is very useful because it means that my project is portable and can be used on any system with with docker installed regardless of their installed dependencies and system setup.

The workplace at Antleaf is relaxed and quiet with occasional conversation. It is nice and spacious so everyone has their own space.

I would say this workplace is perfect for me because it is visually appealing and also relaxed and quiet in a way that makes it easy to focus. When I'm here the time really flies and I really get into a flow and finish my work quickly.
