# Day three

On day three I added a graph which visualized the moisture data and I began to lay down the foundations for controlling the range of data shown in the graph. I also sat in on a call with the [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en).

So far this week creating the little joe dashboard with Flask has been a success and is still ongoing which is positive.

I would like to improve controlling the data range of the graph.
